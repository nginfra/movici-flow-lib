/**
 * StatusTracker can be used to report progress / errors during the asynchronous resolution
 * of tasks, eg when downloading tapefiles to be used by visualizers.
 *
 * In the constructor, the owner of the status tracker (eg. the VizualizerElement) registers which
 * tasks it expects status from and the different weight for each task towards the total progress.
 *
 * Multiple streams of tasks can then each register themselves and indicate which tasks they
 * report progress on. Every stream is given equal weight for their respective tasks. The
 * StatusTracker then combines the progress for every stream for every task into a single progress
 * number
 *
 * Progress is reported as a number between 0 and 100
 *
